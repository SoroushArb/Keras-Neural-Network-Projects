# Neural Network Projects with Keras

## Description

This repository contains diverse projects related to Neural Networks implemented using Keras. The provided Python scripts demonstrate various aspects of neural network development, including manual calculations, generalization, and utilization of the Keras library.

## Usage

### Manual Calculation of a Simple Neural Network

To manually calculate a simple neural network, run the initial code section in the script. This section covers forward propagation for a basic neural network.

### Generalizing the Neural Network

The script generalizes the neural network approach to handle networks with multiple hidden layers and nodes. Key functions are provided for initializing a neural network, computing the weighted sum of inputs, and applying the sigmoid activation function.

### Functions

- **initialize_network:** Initializes a neural network with specified parameters.
- **compute_weighted_sum:** Computes the weighted sum of inputs for a node.
- **node_activation:** Applies the sigmoid activation function to a weighted sum.
- **forward_propagate:** Performs forward propagation through the network, computing node outputs.

### Example Usage

1. Initialize a neural network using `initialize_network`.
2. Generate random inputs and compute network predictions with `forward_propagate`.
3. Additional tasks, as described in the comments, showcase the flexibility of the provided functions.

Feel free to explore different network structures and parameters by modifying the code. Enjoy experimenting with neural network predictions!
